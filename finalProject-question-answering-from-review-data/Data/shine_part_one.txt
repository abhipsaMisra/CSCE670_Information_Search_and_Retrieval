InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste DisposerThe Badger 5 isn't terribly expensive but the quality is very suspect. I wouldn't mind if I had to change on out every 4-5 years, but after a year?? That's just not acceptable. It's the labor cost of hiring a pro or your own time to change out a defective unit, and from the sounds of it, defects happen fast and frequently on these. I got the Badger 5 as a result of leaky 3 year old Insinkerator.This lasted almost 1 year exactly when it started making a loud clanking noise whenever it was turned on.

Not sure what I should do at this point. I'll probably see what the mnanufacturer has to say about this.
