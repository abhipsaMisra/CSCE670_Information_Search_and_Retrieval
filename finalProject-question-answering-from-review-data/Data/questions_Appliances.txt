B006BYHPKW Q O 6283 8 how does it do washing cloth diapers . How does it do washing cloth diapers?
B006BYHPKW A ? 6283 349 if i were a mother again i would have no problem buying this product for washing diapers . it has a limited capacity but it keeps the diapers out of the regular household laundry . for busy people it may be impractical beyond infant and early toddler size diapers . but that depends on how much you mind doing several loads a week . i wouldnt mind at all . cloth diapers are the healthiest . babies do not need all the ridiculous chemicals in disposables . i say that with a little authority . i used to work in a research and development department of a baby diaper manufacturing company . trust me . cloth diapers are healthier than disposables . i would never let a disposable touch my baby if i didnt have to . as for the egg you could probably get a dozen and a half newborn diapers in it . probably eight to twelve toddler diapers . i dont think it is such a pain to hook up to a faucet that is in a second bathroom or a utility room . otherwise it would be kind of a pain n a kitchen or only bathroom . the full wash is about thirty minutes . wash and no rise is about fifteen . just remember to turn the water off before removing the hose from the faucet . i wish my mom had it in the 1950s and 1960s when she had eight children and several in cloth diapers at any given time . i was an oldest daughter and often changed the cloth diapers and rinsed them in the toilet . then put them in the bleach pail . i would have loved the ego egg . just take the diapers out of the pail and put them in the egg . run it and then wring them out . throw them in the dryer or hang them up . you dont have to mix them in with regular laundry and you can dry them together fold them and put them away . If I were a mother again, I would have no problem buying this product for washing diapers. It has a limited capacity, but it keeps the diapers out of the regular household laundry. For busy people it may be impractical beyond infant and early toddler size diapers. But that depends on how much you mind doing several loads a week. I wouldn't mind at all. Cloth diapers are the healthiest. Babies do NOT need all the ridiculous chemicals in disposables. I say that with a little authority. I used to work in a research and development department of a baby diaper manufacturing company. Trust me. Cloth diapers are healthier than disposables. I would never let a disposable touch my baby if I didn't have to. As for the egg, you could probably get a dozen and a half newborn diapers in it. Probably eight to twelve toddler diapers. I don't think it is such a pain to hook up to a faucet that is in a second bathroom or a utility room. Otherwise it would be kind of a pain n a kitchen or only bathroom. The full wash is about thirty minutes. Wash and no rise is about fifteen. Just remember to turn the water off before removing the hose from the faucet! I wish my mom had it in the 1950's and 1960's when she had eight children and several in cloth diapers at any given time. I was an oldest daughter and often changed the cloth diapers and rinsed them in the toilet. Then put them in the bleach pail. I would have loved the ego egg. Just take the diapers out of the pail and put them in the egg. Run it and then wring them out. Throw them in the dryer or hang them up. You don't have to mix them in with regular laundry and you can dry them together, fold them and put them away.

I think of my Wonderwash as a hand crank front loader. The key to the Wonderwash is to not over load it. You need head space so that the cloths can tumble while washing and rinsing. I use liquid detergent and softener together while washing, which consists of 200 rotations forward and back. I then let the cloths drain and I refill the tub for a rinse cycle. After another 200 rotations, I drain the water and put the cloths in my spin dryer, which will remove the soap, softener and dyes. I return the clothing to the Wonderwash for the final rinse of 200 rotations and then back to the spin dryer where the water comes out pretty clear and if it doesn't, then i go for another rinse. Keep in mind you can not do your laundry in bulk and for this reason, I believe, that my cloths come out cleaner, which you will notice with your colored cloths by how much dye will be removed when using the Wonderwash and a spin dryer combination for the first time. Cloths that I've had for years, when washed in my Wonderwash for the first time, released a lot of dye, which totally shocked me and made me realize that my cloths weren't really clean at all.
